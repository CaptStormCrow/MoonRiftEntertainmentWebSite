                "MoonRift Entertainment officially began in the spring of 2014
                through a GoFundMe Campaign to make the logo that you see today.
                At 4:00 PM on September 17th, 2014, the first meeting with
                MoonRift Entertainment took place. The fledgling studio was
                funded by an $8,000 loan, but six months later the money ran
                out. The game was nowhere near functional, the scope of the
                project was overloaded, and I realized just how new we were in
                the field of game development. After a failed Kickstarter in
                2016 for Nyx the Chameleon, morale plummeted, and people left.
                In this forced existential crisis, there was a fork in the road
                and a decision to be made.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to double down, going back to school for my Master’s
                in Business Administration (SDSU) and Master’s in Game Design
                (NYFA). In the Summer of 2020, (yes that 2020), I restarted
                MoonRift Entertainment with our first class of members. This
                time my goal was to find people from diverse backgrounds and
                build an atmosphere of collaboration and support, leaning on
                each other for guidance and developing our capabilities. Since
                then, we have grown into an indie family with 20+ members all
                dedicated to building games that we enjoy making. Although we
                are young, we have the drive to see this through and work every
                day to improve our skill sets. I am a fan of an old saying ‘The
                harder we work, the luckier we’ll get’, and this is just our
                beginning.”
