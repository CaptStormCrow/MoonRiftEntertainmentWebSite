              "MoonRift Entertainment officially began in the spring of 2014
              through a GoFundMe Campaign to make the logo that you see today.
              At 4:00 PM on September 17th, 2014, the first meeting with
              MoonRift Entertainment took place. The fledgling studio was funded
              by an $8,000 loan, but six months later the money ran out. The
              game was nowhere near functional, the scope of the project was
              overloaded, and I realized just how new we were in the field of
              game development. After a failed Kickstarter in 2016 for Nyx the
              Chameleon, morale plummeted, and people left. In this forced
              existential crisis, there was a fork in the road and a decision to
              be made.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to double down, going back to school for my Master’s in
              Business Administration (SDSU) and Master’s in Game Design (NYFA).
              In the Summer of 2020, (yes that 2020), I restarted MoonRift
              Entertainment with our first class of members. This time my goal
              was to find people from diverse backgrounds and build an
              atmosphere of collaboration and support, leaning on each other for
              guidance and developing our capabilities. Since then, we have
              grown into an indie family with 20+ members all dedicated to
              building games that we enjoy making. Although we are young, we
              have the drive to see this through and work every day to improve
              our skill sets. I am a fan of an old saying ‘The harder we work,
              the luckier we’ll get’, and this is just our beginning.”
