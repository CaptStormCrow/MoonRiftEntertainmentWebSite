              Kiwi is a three level auto-scroller that focuses on the endless
              adventure during which the player must help maneuver the bird in
              order to dodge environmental obstacles whilst trying to not get
              killed by enemies! The powerup store gives the player an
              opportunity to utilize the coins collected throughout the game as
              well as a greater chance to get higher scores on the leaderboard.
              Players can also get information regarding the featured endangered
              species they will encounter throughout the game! This current beta
              version of the game includes three levels, all in New Zealand.

                Welcome to the Poacher's Forest! This is the first level that
                Kiwi has to face in order to find his parents. Kiwi is able to
                land on stone pillars to recover his flight energy. However, be
                mindful of the vines and flying ferrets. Try throwing a kiwi at
                'em to take them down! The gusts of wind will help Kiwi fy more
                easily.

                This is Auckland Airways. In here, Kiwi is able to use planes to
                land on. There will be clouds that you can bounce on! You will
                encounter hedgehogs on this level, but do not be fooled by their
                cuteness, these little guys are ready to take Kiwi down and they
                will shoot their quills at him to do so. Your kiwi fruit will
                destroy their quills, use that to your advantage! Some of these
                hedgehogs will also chase you! Are you up for the challenge?

                This is the last level in Kiwi's journey. Help Kiwi fly through
                a volcano island. You will face rising magma waves that you will
                need to avoid, while also dodging the falling meteors. The
                meteors will chase you, so prepare your kiwi fruit to knock them
                out. You will get the chance to stop the falling meteors by
                shooting your kiwi fruit at the active volcano. But, you must
                get the kiwi right inside of the volcano or it will not work!
                Think you you can take the heat and reunite Kiwi with his
                parents?
